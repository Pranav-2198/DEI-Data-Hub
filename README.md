1. Introduction:

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are crucial to the success of any organization in the modern world. The success of an organization's DEI efforts may be tracked and measured in large part because of HR analytics. A well-designed database is necessary for tracking and measuring DEI parameters effectively. In this project, we will create a database for HR metric analytics based on a DEI Measurement Dataset. This database will give HR professionals the resources they need to monitor and assess the DEI initiatives of their organization and base decisions on the data. 

2. Target Audience:

The Human Resource professionals, Project Managers, and Senior Executives in organizations of any size and industry who are interested in improving their DEI metrics and promoting a more inclusive and diverse workplace will be the target audience. This database can be used to monitor and examine many HR indicators connected to DEI, such as Employee Engagement, Diversity in the workforce, Pay Equity, and Retention Rates. Making data-driven decisions to enhance HR policies and practices linked to DEI can be done using the insights obtained from the database.

3. Sample Data Sources:

Our project involves merging two datasets, the Human Resources Data Set and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Measures Dataset from Kaggle, to create a unified database that will provide insights into DEI metrics and enable workplaces to foster organizational success and employee satisfaction. To ensure that our database is manageable and focused, we have limited the rows from the original 311 rows in the Human Resources dataset and 10,000 rows in the DEI dataset as per the scope and requirement of the project.
